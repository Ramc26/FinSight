# üß† FinSight: Your Documents' AI Overlord

Ever stared at a PDF and wished it would just tell you what's important? Yeah, me too. FinSight is a tool that stops you from having to *actually* read boring documents. You upload a file, and a squad of AI agents tear it apart, figure out what's inside, and then wait for you to ask questions.

It's like having an unpaid intern who loves paperwork, never sleeps, and doesn't steal your snacks.

## ‚ú® Features That Actually Work (Most of the Time)

* **AI Agent Squad:** Powered by **CrewAI**, this isn't just one AI, it's a team. The first agent figures out *what* the document is (a ticket, an invoice, a top-secret plan), and the others extract the juicy details.
* **Chat with Your Docs:** A slick **Streamlit** UI lets you have a conversation with your PDF. Ask for a summary, find specific info, or just see if it's having a good day.
* **Password Whisperer:** Got a locked PDF? No problem. The app will politely ask for the password in the UI, not in some scary terminal window.
* **Knows Its Stuff:** It's smart enough to tell the difference between a bank statement and a train ticket, so its analysis is actually relevant.
* **Sidebar of Secrets:** See all the text and tables the agents have extracted, neatly organized in the sidebar for your viewing pleasure.

**2. Finding the Big Spenders:** Ask it to find large transactions, and it'll hunt them down and even do the math for you. Because who has time for calculators?

**3. Spotting Your Habits:** Curious where your money *really* goes every month? It can find all your repetitive transactions in seconds.
